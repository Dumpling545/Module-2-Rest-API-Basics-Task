> NOTE: User credentials is only added as part of educational task 
and won't inflict any harm since provided user has quite low level 
of permissions and instance of Jenkins is not available from the Internet.
However, keeping any credentials in the remote repository is 
a ***severe security breach*** and must be avoided by all means in projects
intended for production.
